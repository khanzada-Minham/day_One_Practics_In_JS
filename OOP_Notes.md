## why use OOP


## Parts of OOP
Object literal.

- Constructor function.
- Prototypes
- Classes
- Instances (new , this)

## 4 Pillars

- Encapsulation  => Bundling the data (properties) and methods (functions)
- Abstraction    => Hiding the complex implementation details
- Inheritance    => Allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class
- Polymorphism   => In polymorphism the same method results in different actions depending on the object it is acting upon.
